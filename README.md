# `rust-fp`
A better fingerprint library than `libfprint`

## Why
- `libfprint` seems to not support fingerprint readers with their own built-in matching
- `libfprint` is written in C, not Rust
- `libfprint` is hard to use

## Goals
- Support enrolling fingerprints through a GUI and CLI
- Support authenticating with fingerprints with PAM
- Be easy to develop new drivers, even if you just have 1 test device and it's the same device that you're using to code
- Support Chromebook fingerprint sensors
- Be modular and easy to use in non-Linux environments (such as RedoxOS)
- Be easy to set up a development environment to build and edit the code
- Provide high quality auto-complete in code editors
- Be as close to 100% Rust as possible with minimal non-Rust dependencies

## Status
### Drivers
Currently, `rust-fp` is not yet written. It will eventually support Chromebook fingerprint readers, and other people can add drivers for their own fp sensors.

### Integration with desktop environments
Desktop Environment | Status      | Comments
--------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KDE Plasma          | Working     | Works by replacing libfprint PAM module with rust-fp PAM module
GNOME               | Not working | Just replacing libfprint PAM module with rust-fp PAM module doesn't work. See https://github.com/ChocolateLoverRaj/rust-fp/issues/3
COSMIC              | Planned     | Since COSMIC is written in Rust ðŸ¦€, it shouldn't be too hard to add nice support for rust-fp unlock. Maybe even skip PAM entirely and directly add rust-fp integration to COSMIC. Once COSMIC is officially released and I switch to COSMIC, I'll work on this.

If you get this working with another DE, create a PR adding it to the table.

## Installation
### NixOS
Create a file called `rust-fp.nix` in `/etc/nixos` with the contents:
```nix
{ lib, pkgs, ... }:

let
  rust-fp = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "ChocolateLoverRaj";
    repo = "cros-fp-pam";
    rev = "b38c1b93a0f1015629a7c8f77bea77ef7e9ac76a";
    hash = "sha256-NLK2ImU7Bn6hjMFwchCDp79+QumvLwWUMp48xXjU0bE=";
  };
  rust-fp-dbus-interface-config = (pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation rec {
    name = "rust-fp-pam";
    src = "${rust-fp}/dbus-interface";
    installPhase = ''
      mkdir -p $out/share/dbus-1/system.d
      cp $src/org.rust_fp.RustFp.conf $out/share/dbus-1/system.d
      echo Cros FP Pam output at $out
    '';
  });
  rust-fp-dbus-interface = with pkgs; rustPlatform.buildRustPackage rec {
    pname = "rust-fp-dbus-interface";
    version = "1.0.0";
    cargoLock = {
      lockFile = ./rust-fp-Cargo.lock;
      outputHashes = {
        "crosec-0.1.0" = "sha256-q6RzJ3dtbLC82O3j1V+0d3krFGwDWHm1eBPZdATpMZ4=";
      };
    };
    src = rust-fp;
    buildAndTestSubdir = "dbus-interface";
    nativeBuildInputs = [
      rustPlatform.bindgenHook
      rustPlatform.cargoBuildHook
    ];
  };
  rust-fp-cli = with pkgs; rustPlatform.buildRustPackage rec {
    pname = "rust-fp-cli";
    version = "1.0.0";
    cargoLock = {
      lockFile = ./rust-fp-Cargo.lock;
      outputHashes = {
        "crosec-0.1.0" = "sha256-q6RzJ3dtbLC82O3j1V+0d3krFGwDWHm1eBPZdATpMZ4=";
      };
    };
    src = rust-fp;
    buildAndTestSubdir = "cli";
    nativeBuildInputs = [
      rustPlatform.bindgenHook
      rustPlatform.cargoBuildHook
    ];
  };
  rust-fp-pam-module = with pkgs; rustPlatform.buildRustPackage rec {
    pname = "rust-fp-pam-module";
    version = "1.0.0";
    cargoLock = {
      lockFile = ./rust-fp-Cargo.lock;
      outputHashes = {
        "crosec-0.1.0" = "sha256-q6RzJ3dtbLC82O3j1V+0d3krFGwDWHm1eBPZdATpMZ4=";
      };
    };
    src = rust-fp;
    buildAndTestSubdir = "pam-module";
    nativeBuildInputs = [
      rustPlatform.bindgenHook
      rustPlatform.cargoBuildHook
    ];
    buildInputs = [
      pam
    ];
  };
in
{
  systemd.services.rust-fp-dbus-interface = {
    enable = true;
    description = "Gives normal user access to enrolling and matching fingerprints";
    serviceConfig = {
      Type = "exec";
      ExecStart = "${rust-fp-dbus-interface}/bin/rust-fp-dbus-interface";
    };
    wantedBy = [ "multi-user.target" ];
  };

  # Example: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/239770#issuecomment-1608589113
  security.pam.services.kde-fingerprint.text = ''
    auth    sufficient    ${rust-fp-pam-module}/lib/librust_fp_pam_module.so
    account sufficient    ${rust-fp-pam-module}/lib/librust_fp_pam_module.so
  '';

  environment.systemPackages = [
    rust-fp-dbus-interface-config
    rust-fp-cli
  ];
}
```
Then, import the file in `configuration.nix`:
```nix
{ ... }:

{
    imports = [
        ./rust-fp.nix
    ];
}
```

### Manually, in normal mutable Linux distros
#### Get the code
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ChocolateLoverRaj/rust-fp
```

#### Install [Rust ðŸ¦€](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

#### Install the build dependency package
##### With Nix
Even if you're not on NixOS, you can probably install [`Nix`](https://nixos.org/download/) on any distro and just get everything you need with `nix develop`.
##### Without Nix
Or you can find the packages that your distribution provides and install them with your other package manager. You probably need `pam`, and maybe `clang`.

#### Build everything
Run
```sh
cargo b --release
```
That should build everything. If you are testing changes to the code, then just run `cargo b` to build in debug mode.

#### Install D-Bus config
```sh
sudo cp dbus-interface/org.rust_fp.RustFp.conf /usr/share/dbus-1/system.d
```

#### Install `rust-fp-dbus-interface`
```sh
sudo cp target/release/rust-fp-dbus-interface /usr/local/bin
```

#### Create the systemd service
Create a file `/etc/systemd/system/rust-fp-dbus-interface.service`:
```
[Unit]
Description=Gives normal user access to enrolling and matching fingerprints

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rust-fp-dbus-interface
Type=exec

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
You can start it with
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now rust-fp-dbus-interface
```

#### Configure KDE fingerprint PAM
Copy the PAM module to the location where PAM modules belong
```bash
sudo cp target/release/librust_fp_pam_module.so /lib64/security
```
Depending on the distro, the folder might be `/lib` or `/lib64`. On Fedora it's `/lib64`.

Create / modify the file `/etc/pam.d/kde-fingerprint`:
```
auth    sufficient    librust_fp_pam_module.so
account sufficient    librust_fp_pam_module.so
```

#### Install the CLI
```bash
sudo cp target/release/rust-fp /usr/local/bin
```

## Usage
All you really need to do is enroll some fingerprints with the `rust-fp` CLI. Depending on your Chromebook, you will a maximum number of templates that can be loaded onto the fingerprint sensor at a time. It's probably 5. Just typing `rust-fp` will show the help page. Run `rust-fp enroll` to enroll your fingerprints. Then lock the screen and you should be able to unlock with either your password or an enrolled fingerprint.

## Troubleshooting
- See [the list of known issues](https://github.com/ChocolateLoverRaj/rust-fp/labels/bug).
- Try restart the systemd service
- Try clearing stored templates with `rust-fp clear` and then enrolling new ones.
